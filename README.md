# Pseudo-Boom
We have analysed and worked upon on the real data of 2019 General LokSabha Elections from which we have inferred certain parameters which leads to some insightful information. 
We inferred the statewise criminal count of both candidates as well as winners.
Also we inferred the educational qualification of the candidates and made a barplot of education vs criminal
Gender comparison was also displayed by using pie chart
Got the count of categories of the candidates and plotted a bar graph of the same
Party wise candidate seat allocation and criminal candidates per party were also plotted on graphs
